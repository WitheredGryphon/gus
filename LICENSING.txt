Licensing yada yada

Some of the stuff used here is not written by me. Thus, if you want to re-use these parts,
you should probably adhere to their licensing terms. In particular, this is about these:

Shared/zip/*
Shared/zlib/*
    These are implementations of zlib in pure c# (because I don't want to mess with DLLs
	and all that crap ;-)
	They are licensed under the Microsoft Public License

I also used various snippets of other people's code (if it was available under some sort
of public domain license) here and there (e.g. in the generic CRC functions), but I tried 
hard to credit each of these occurrences.

All the rest is under a "I don't care what you do with it" license. Seriously, all that
license bickering has swallowed sooo much of everyone's hard work (just think of OSM
deleting thousands of roads which had to be re-mapped by volunteers) that I'm kinda
sick of it. You want to use my code? Fine, go ahead. You want to use it in a GPL project?
Do so. MIT? Apache? Public Domain? MSPL? Please go ahead!

The code is hereby formally Multi-Licensed under any open source license you can think of,
and additionally public domain (or "free as in beer" in places where there's no concept of 
PD)

So not that this is out of the way, get back to coding! :-)
