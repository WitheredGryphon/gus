TODO:
- convert all unpackers to use generic FileEntry type instead of per-module specific ones
  - Done: AFSUnpacker, FalcomUnpacker (ZweiUnpacker still missing), NISUnpacker
- Move ZipConstants into ZipUnpacker class
- do something (generic) about "/" vs "\" in file paths
- more unpackers
- packing support for more unpackers
- more data transformers
- We need a way for plugins/unpackers to open additional datafiles
  - some archives need this as kind of "index" file or similar
  - should probably be restricted to the directory of the data file itself, or 1 or 2 parent directories
