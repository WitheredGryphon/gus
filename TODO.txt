TODO:
- more unpackers
- packing support for more unpackers
- more data transformers
- We need a way for plugins/unpackers to open additional datafiles
  - some archives need this as kind of "index" file or similar
  - should probably be restricted to the directory of the data file itself, or 1 or 2 parent directories
